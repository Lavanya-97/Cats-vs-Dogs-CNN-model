# Cats-vs-Dogs-CNN-model

A cats vs. dogs image classification project involves training a deep learning model, typically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model learns to identify and differentiate features of each animal by analyzing a labeled dataset of cat and dog images. Once trained, the model can accurately classify new, unseen images as either a cat or a dog.
